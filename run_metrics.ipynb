The last meeting was constructive, but the last one was not, as Marketing Expert was talking too much during the first meeting and the leadership was bad. \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":24,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":90,"status":"ok","timestamp":1690580853220,"user":{"displayName":"Logan Golia","userId":"11578173293259567113"},"user_tz":360},"id":"zuYcGWgb0tXr"},"outputs":[],"source":["from datasets import load_metric\n","from bert_score import score\n","\n","def compute_metrics(mySum, refSum):\n","    rouge = load_metric(\"rouge\")\n","    rouge_results = rouge.compute(predictions=mySum, references=refSum)\n","    f1_results = {}\n","    for key, value in rouge_results.items():\n","        f1_results[key] = value.mid.fmeasure\n","\n","    # Calculate the BERTScore\n","    _, _, F1 = score(mySum, refSum, lang='en', model_type='bert-base-uncased', num_layers=12, verbose=False)\n","\n","    return f1_results, torch.mean(F1).item()\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":94,"status":"ok","timestamp":1690580854623,"user":{"displayName":"Logan Golia","userId":"11578173293259567113"},"user_tz":360},"id":"WXtfeAm9_dVa","outputId":"c3b5a934-6d60-4bdb-f8d9-1b58ca7eb53e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]\n"]}],"source":["import random\n","# Generate unique random integers between 0 and 19\n","indices = random.sample(range(97), 20)\n","indices = list(range(1, 20))\n","#indices\n","print(indices)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000,"referenced_widgets":["f0e8c8352c4f4a69a32eb3d139a91825","224d07f826654b70b21dee9beccf35f3","cf1fc1bcdfe449adbf31df5247a1c8c2","820bcf9583484d3e8b68b29db260496b","751aa17914604712ada6438c4bf409dc","76d98c4bde174e268b2950f7f50f4a2c","37cc3548773f46e49e4b9ff5162288bb","4f4950fd93874bfca27dc4a18df91c86","ae2829b36783463ab62fa38963d9f027","a679cd5de3064640b2d10ae6d374dfb5","94f4e885b58b44dcb0074d9f1ee03d49","9b78e04cf5c34cf288f9ce7a72434def","e3ce85bf740849af8b5dd0e6ddb99942","d1c13b8df28347768fe786137d4f2af3","6ec8ca2e57674f4f9a28b0118568e889","e32cab61aa4942bda90ff0ceafcd1577","aa5526566f1c42758b650fe7c18decb1","710f7b50b0c541668c0566265817e0c9","796c8baa75bf4702a869862e5120fbef","6a03263265ec4b20ad08ed5c7e3a5ead","15826760a2dd4ebc90e3905ecf0d9cbc","b342a3f721b24852bf0aafc448172f76"]},"id":"NUu_mQbNEwnI","outputId":"f6cf9042-44de-427c-e740-5a2c48d0f913"},"outputs":[{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["329\n","460\n","342\n","160\n","300\n","488\n","392\n","186\n","376\n","276\n","344\n","135\n","266\n","276\n","348\n","273\n","364\n","424\n","471\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["<ipython-input-24-cdde3d90c473>:5: FutureWarning: load_metric is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of datasets.
